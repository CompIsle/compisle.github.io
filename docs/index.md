# Welcome to CompIsle MkDocs

Documentation repository for the CompIsle GitHub group.
This is a collation rather than a collection - documents are included here if the best method of delivery is MarkDown fuelled HTML served via a static site. 

It is not a Wiki: documents here are essentially independent of each other and links between them are deprecated (fragile: likely to break :thumbsdown: )
