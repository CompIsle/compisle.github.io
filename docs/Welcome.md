## Level 3

## Equipment

All students will need the following

+ Pens/Pencils - you will need both at different times, but must always have something to write with.

+ Access to a calculator - if you are doing GCSE Maths you will need a discrete calculator and should be guided by the maths department as to the best model. For main course purposes, the desktop calculator in Windows or on your phone will be fine *provided that you know how to use it*.
